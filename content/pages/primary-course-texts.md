The readings in this seminar are not geared to providing a general history or theory of cities. Our focus will be on selected readings that are, for the most part, outstanding prose on cities—many offer fresh insight on perennial problems; most are models you’ll want to read and reread. (My approach means you will miss important thinkers on “the city,” but the consolation is that you will discover lovely voices you wouldn’t have thought to listen for). Along the course of our explorations, we’ll discuss ideas that are execrable or laughable, not to scorn or mock others—after all, we all have ideas that we’ll one day laugh or cringe at—but to get a firmer grasp on understanding cities.

Recommended References on Style and Usage 
------------------------------------------

Writing, rewriting, revision, reading, writing writing writing. And then more revision. That’s a good way to think of this class. Fine reference books on writing that are helpful, but not necessary, for this class, but that will be of great benefit if they are within close reach:

It would help to also have these nearby, to be dipped into time and again until their principles are absorbed:
